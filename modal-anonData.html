            <h3>What's the purpose for collecting this data and what will be done
                with it?</h3>
            <p>Your Trolley Trends data could be very valuable in observing the Cost of
                Living crisis, it could be used to identify rising prices or
                shrink-flation. It could be used to enhance or interface with other
                datasets to understand calorific consumption trends or you could see how
                your shopping habits compare to others in the same area. Exactly how it
                will be used has not been defined upfront, this is permitted as the data
                is anonymous.</p>
            <p>The intention is to make the dataset available
                to anyone who wants to use it under an <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">
                    Open Data Commons</a> licence.</p> However, before any public release,
            it will be necessary to further evaluate the likelihood of identifiability
            and this is likely to depend on the size and variance of the data collected.

            <h3>What data is collected?</h3>
            <p>Three datasets are submitted. The datasets and a description of the
                fields are: </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>guid - a theoretically unique identifier generated based on
                            the contents of this record (one-way hash), this is so that
                            if the record is resubmitted, the duplicate can be
                            identified</li>
                        <li>date - the date, with the time removed, on which the

                            purchase was made</li>
                        <li>name - the name of the product as supplied in the original

                            original data</li>
                        <li>storeFormat - the storeFormat as supplied in the original
                            data</li>
                        <li>guid - a theoretically unique identifier generated based on
                            the contents of this record (one-way hash), this is so that
                            if the record is resubmitted, the duplicate can be

                    Weekly data
                    <ul>
                        <li>weekCommencing - the date of the Monday of the week which
                            this data is summed for</li>
                        <li>totalBasketValueGross - the sum of basketValueGross for
                            purchases made within this week shuffled within 20p
                            of the original value</li>
                        <li>totalBasketValueNet - the sum of basketValueNet for
                            purchases made within this week shuffled by the same amount as the totalBasketValueGross
                        </li>
                        <li>totalOverallBasketSavings - the sum of overallBasketSavings

                        <li>totalItems - the total number of items for all purchases
                            made within this week</li>
                        <li>submission - a theoretically unique randomly generated
                            identifier for this submission. This enables weeks in the
                            same submission to be grouped, but a subsequent submission
                            containing the same records would generate a new
                            identifier</li>
                        <li>outcode - the first part of the postcode (to the left of the space)
                            taken from the Clubcard account postal address field. This
                            will indicate the current region of residence.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The three datasets do not have keys which relate them to each other.</p>

            <p>The Weekly data dataset is the only dataset where the records are grouped by submission.</p>

            <h3 class="py-3">How is the data anonymous and not merely pseudo-anonymous?</h3>
            <p>Psuedo-anonymous data does not have any individual identifiers but can, with the use of additional
                information, be
                attributed back to an individual.
                Anonymous data cannot be related back to an individual by 'means reasonably likely to be used'.</p>
            <p>Pseudo-anonymised data is still considered
                personal data and so falls under the remit of GDPR and other data
                production legislation.</p>
            <p>To collect, retain and share this data, it is important to ensure it is anonymous.</p>
            <p>N.B. The Clubcard data may refer to multiple individuals within a single
                household, or with another relationship, however, as it may also relate to a single person,
                'individual' is the
                term that has been used and applied. </p>

            <h3 class="py-3">Test cases for anonymisation vs psuedo-anonymisation</h3>
            <p>
                The below contains the challenges and reasoning to support that the data is pseudo-anonymised.
            </p>

            <h4 class="h5">The following supplementary personal information is considered to be 'reasonably likely
                to be used':</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Observation of an individual checkout (store, time, potentially the amount spent, and
                    potentially some items purchased).</li>
                <li>A receipt belonging to a known individual (store, time, amount spent, and items purchased).</li>
                <li>A bank or credit card statement (store, date, and amount spent).</li>
                <li> An awareness of the postcode outcode (the part to the left of the space) of the individual's
                    residence.</li>
                <li>A version of the JSON data that was submitted (but not containing all the same information).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="h5">Would it be possible to identify exactly what products the individual purchased?</h4>
            <p class="fw-semibold">No.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no relationship between a purchase and the items purchased or between products
                    purchased together, so it
                    would not be possible to retrieve the items relating to that purchase.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="h5">Would it be possible to retrieve additional information about a purchase?</h4>
            <p class="fw-semibold">Reasonably unlikely.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Assuming that the store, purchase time and basketValueNet (amount spent) are known - the
                    additional information that could be
                    available are the totalItems, basketValueGross and overallBasketSavings.
                <li>Only the date (not the time) is collected for a purchase, this
                    significantly reduces the likelihood of identifying a single purchase in the data as many
                    purchases will be made in a store on a single day.</li>
                <li>The amount spent (basketValueNet) is offset by up to 20p, this data perturbation makes it
                    further unlikely that
                    anyone could reasonably identify the purchase record in order to retrieve the additional (very
                    minimal) data.</li>

            </ul>

            <h4 class="h5">Would it be possible to identify what other purchases the individual made?</h4>
            <p class="fw-semibold">No.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no relationship between a purchase and other purchases made by the same individual.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="h5">Would it be possible to identify how much the individual spent overall or in other weeks?
            </h4>
            <p class="fw-semibold">Reasonably unlikely.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The total purchases made within a week are summed (data generalisation) without the store
                    information but with the postcode outcode.</li>
                <li>This breaks a potentially known interaction with a single store and
                    should introduce a wider subset of potential data subjects.</li>
                <li>As the amounts are summed, it would be necessary to know all the purchases for a whole week and
                    not just a single purchase event.</li>
                <li>The amounts spent are offset by up to 20p, this data perturbation means that, even if only one
                    purchase was made in a week,
                    it is unlikely someone could reasonably, and with confidence, identify the weekly records made
                    by an individual</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="h5">If I submitted a subsequent (or earlier) version of the JSON data for the same Clubcard,
                would that give me a key to
                identify information from a previous submission?</h4>
            <p class="fw-semibold">No.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any identifiers that are generated (hashed) from the data itself are for single records - so a
                    product or a purchase. This makes it possible to
                    identify that the data submitted is a duplicate, but there is no relationship between those
                    records and others.
                </li>
                <li>For the weekly data, which does retain a relationship between records, the identifier is
                    randomly generated per submission, so if
                    the data was submitted again another identifier would be generated and it would not be possible
                    to relate these records to the previously
                    submitted records.</li>
            </ul>
