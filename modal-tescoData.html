            <p>There are some peculiarities with the examples of Tesco Clubcard data I have seen so far. I have tried
                to do some appropriate data cleansing, however, as I have only had a few datasets to test with there are
                likely to
                be oddities that I have not yet seen.</p>

            <p>The analysis and data visualisations can only be as good as the source data. I've made best endeavours to
                interpret it in a way I believe to be reasonably accurate but it is provided 'as is' without warranty or
                liability.
                You can validate any calculations by referring to your source data in the JSON file.</p>

            <h3>Known Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Broadly, the Tesco Clubcard data consists of 'Purchases' which is a transaction that occurred on a
                    specific date at a specific store (or was a delivery). Each Purchase contains the products that were
                    purchased.  There is a separate collection in the data relating to 'orders' which appear to be Deliveries and
                    include delivery costs but it is not easy to directly relate these back to purchases, therefore,
                    'orders' have been ignored.</li>

                <li>The purchase has a 'basketValueNet' that appears to match the amount paid, therefore this has been
                    used for the majority of calculations. If the payment was partly paid by voucher, this has not been
                    taken into account.</li>

                <li>There is a total amount of 'overallBasketSavings' per purchase. In older transactions this appears
                    to be the difference between 'basketValueNet' and 'basketValueGross', however in more recent
                    transactions that relationship has been broken, therefore 'basketValueGross' is always ignored.</li>

                <li>For older purchases, the price per item appears to be the price before any savings. In these
                    records, the product prices multiplied by the quantities would sum up to the 'basketValueGross', if
                    the 'overallBasketSavings' was then deducted, that would equal the 'basketValueNet' which always
                    appeared to match the payment. However, in newer records this relationship has also been lost with
                    the product prices multiplied by the quantities also adds up to the 'basketValueGross', implying
                    that the saving is now included in the product price provided. Therefore it should be noted that
                    there may be some inaccurate item prices.</li>

                <li>Some items appear to be administrative, such as an item to attribute ClubCard points for using your
                    own bags, therefore every item with a price of '0.0' has been excluded.</li>

                <li>Some items relate to delivery costs, however, not every delivery order has a delivery item. These
                    have not been excluded from the data but the sum of them may not equal the total amount spent on
                    delivery.</li>

                <li>While the product 'price' generally seems to be the price per item, there were a handful of examples
                    in my own data where it appeared to be the total price for the quantity purchased. These were quite
                    old purchases and so that has been ignored with the assumption that, for products sold per item, it
                    is always the price for a single item.</li>

                <li>For items that are sold by weight, such as 'Tesco Bananas Loose', the price appears to be the price
                    per 100g, in older purchases a 'weightInGrams' figure was given, that would enable the actual cost
                    incurred to be calculated, however, the weight is not included in more recent purchases. Similarly,
                    there is a 'volumeInLitres' value that appears to only have been populated for motor fuel purchases
                    and is no longer populated. For some of these items, the quantity was given as null, so they have
                    been attributed a quantity of 1. The price given is assumed to be the price per 100g or per litre.
                </li>

                <li>Store names have changed in the dataset over time, for consistency, the stores are grouped on Store
                    ID and the most recent name (which is generally formatted in lowercase and is used for all
                    purchases). There is a 'Purchase Type' field, that seems to differentiate between 'in store',
                    'delivery' and (historically) 'Tesco Direct', however, there may be other values, such as 'Click and
                    Collect' for which I have yet to see example data.</li>

                <li>In more recent purchases, the store name for delivery orders, has been set to a generic value such
                    as 'Grocery England', although the 'store ID' still relates to the shop which picked the order. To
                    minimise anomalies caused by this inconsistency, all purchases with purchaseType of 'ghs' (is a
                    delivery order) have been attributed to a generic delivery store called 'Home Delivery'.</li>

                <li>Some products are listed with a negative quantity, these are presumably products that were ordered
                    but were not delivered, these have been left in the data to give accurate product totals. There were
                    some products with a negative quantity and a negative price, these might have been 'scan as you
                    shop' items that were subsequently removed, however, if that is the case, that doesn't appear to
                    have been applied consistently. These items have had the price made absolute but the quantity
                    remains negative.</li>

                <li>Some datasets had entire purchases with negative totals, these may have been returns and have been
                    left in the data.</li>

                <li>There are products listed as 'Home Delivery Substitution Refund' presumably, this is the difference
                    between the product ordered and the product supplied, but there is also inconsistency with the
                    application of this information (for example the price appears to be a misnomer, e.g. '1000'). As
                    the actual product received is unknown, this information isn't thought to be particularly helpful
                    and these have therefore been excluded.</li>
