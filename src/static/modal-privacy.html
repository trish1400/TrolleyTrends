            <h3>Personal data is not collected</h3>

            <p>The point of this site is to provide client-side visualisation of your loyalty card data. Client-side
                means the data is not submitted to a server,
                the processsing and visualisations are created using javascript in your browser, without the data
                leaving your device. No personal data is collected. You can enable Airplane mode (or similar) before
                submitting your json file.</p>

            <p>If you opt to contribute your data, then the data is <em>anonymised</em>, client-side in your browser, before it
                is submitted.  This data is anonymised, not just pseudo-anonymised. See the bottom of this modal for more details on this.
            </p>

            <p>As no personal data is collected, all of this is outside of the scope of GPDR and similar legislation, however, I think transparency is 
                important hence all these words.</p>

            <h3>Processors</h3>
            <p>The site is hosted with Cloudflare (about 20% of web goes through Cloudflare in some form).</p>
            <p>If you submit your <em>anonymised</em> data, it goes via an Cloudflare Worker into Azure Blob Storage and then a Azure Function App puts it 
                into an Azure SQL database.</p>


            <h3>Cookies</h3>

            <p>I don't set any first party cookies.</p>

            <p>Cloudflare uses some strictly necessary cookies. You can read
                <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare's
                    privacy policy</a> and
                <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/cookie-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare's
                    cookie policy</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Analytics</h3>

            <p>The only analytics are <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/web-analytics" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">Cloudflare web analytics</a>.
                I get twitchy about Google Analytics (what does 'consent mode' really do?) and anything like Hotjar in
                this context would be
                completely against the principles of retaining your data clientside. Cloudflare Web Analytics does not
                use any client-side state, such as cookies or localStorage, to collect usage metrics. It also doesn't
                'fingerprint' individuals via their IP address, User Agent string, or any other data for the purpose of
                displaying analytics.</p>

            <p>I've also not used any CDNs for third-party packages to avoid any potential for tracking there.</p>

            <h3>What about IP addresses, aren't they personal data?</h3>

            <p>No, it depends on the context, if you are an ISP, then maybe. For most services using IP addresses, it makes no sense,
                 at worst they could be a key to link psuedo-anonyomised datasets, but if you have no other personal data, the idea that 
                 IP addresses alone are personal data makes no sense.  The EU General Court ruled so in April 2023 <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A62020TJ0557" 
                 target="_blank" rel="noopener">SRB v EDPS</a>.</p>
                 <p>Where possible, logs are kept to a minimum, not least because I'm not paying to store logs.</p>
