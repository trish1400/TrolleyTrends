            <h3>How accessible is this site?</h3>

                <p>It's ok but, as it is a visualiser, there are going to be some limitations.</p>
                <p>Most of the information is provided in markup so is accessible.</p>
                <p>Colours used for text have a contrast of 3:1 which meets WCAG 2.2 AA as the text is large.</p>
                <p>For dynamic charts with unknown series, I've used the <a href="https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                    Wong and Tol colour palettes</a>, this does mean that they may repeat if you have a lot of series, but I figured that was better for accessibility.</p>
                <p>I've added Aria tags and the markup should be decent.</p>
                <p>Where possible, i.e. for the stores pie chart, I've repeated the data shown in the chart in the legend.</p>
                <p>You can zoom to 400%</p>
                <p>All your data is available for download in CSVs.</p>

            <h3>What's not so accessible?</h3>
                <p>You can't navigate into the charts using the keyboard.</p>
                <p>The animations aren't great for accessibility, but I wanted to tell a story.</p> 
                <p>Some of the charts on a small screen or at a high zoom are not easy to read.</p>


            <h3>To be improved</h3>

                <p>I'm going to explore allowing users to opt out of the animations.</p>
