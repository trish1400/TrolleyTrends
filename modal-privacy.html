            This policy relates to the Trolley Trends site located at https://www.trolleytrends.com


            <h3>Personal data is not collected</h3>

            <p>The point of this site is to provide client-side visualisation of your loyalty card data. Client-side
                means the data is not submitted to a server,
                the processsing and visualisations are created using javascript in your browser, without the data
                leaving your device. No personal data is collected</p>

            <p>If you opt to contribute your data, then the data is anonymised, client-side in your browser, before it is submitted. 
                This data is anonymised, not just pseudo-anonymised, further information about that can be found here.</p>
        

            <h3>What loyalty card data does it work with?</h3>

            <p>Presently, only Tesco Clubcard data.</p>

            <p>I've requested my data for a couple of other supermarket loyalty cards which I have, but I've not yet
                received the data and I'm not sure if, When
                I do receive it whether it will be in a standardised format or not.</p>

            <h3>With thanks to...</h3>

                        rel="noopener">GDPR</a></span>: I'll fess up to being a massive GDPR fan. Your right to the data
                held about you in a portable, machine-readable
                format is enshrined under GDPR, without that, this would not be possible. The clarity it provided on
                what is considered Personally Identifiable Information
                (PPI), what it means for data to be psuedo-anonymous vs anonymous also makes it possible to think about
                GPDR as an enabling force, rather than, as it
                often is, a limiting one.</p>

                For taking the enlightened approach of making the process of requesting and receiving your data
                automatic.
                Without that I would not have bothered.</p>

                created most of this (even the logo), while also teaching me and assisting with my frustrations. The
                future is here and it is wild.</p>

            <p><span class="fw-bold">The makers</span>: The various indivduals and organisations that invest time and
                energy into creating frameworks that they then
                allow anyone to use under very permissable licences. It is to stand on the shoulders of giants, namely
