            <h3>Why has this site been created?</h3>

                <p>Mainly, to see if I could.</p>
                <p>The idea behind it was to enable you to understand your own grocery shopping trends via the loyalty card data that 
                    supermarkets collect.</p>
                <p>It was important to me that the visualisation be done 'client-side' (javascript), so all the processing is done without your data 
                    leaving your browser.</p>
                <p>I also hoped that, should it be possible to sufficently anonymise the data client-side, users may be willing to contribute to build a dataset 
                    that may enable us to better understand the cost of living crisis. Data has vast benefits and organisations 
                    that are sufficiently large enough to capture and analyse vast amounts of data, can have an unfair advantages.</p>


            <h3>What loyalty card data does it work with?</h3>

                <p>Presently, only Tesco Clubcard data.</p>

                <p>I've requested my data for a couple of other supermarket loyalty cards which I have, but I've not yet received the data and I'm not sure if, When
                    I do receive it whether it will be in a standardised format or not.</p>

            <h3>With thanks to...</h3>

                <p><span class="fw-bold"><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDPR</a></span>: I'll fess up to being a massive GDPR fan. Your right to the data held about you in a portable, machine-readable 
                    format is enshrined under GDPR, without that, this would not be possible. The clarity it provided on what is considered Personally Identifiable Information 
                    (PPI), what it means for data to be psuedo-anonymous vs anonymous also makes it possible to think about GPDR as an enabling force, rather than, as it
                    often is, a limiting one.</p>

                <p><span class="fw-bold"><a href="https://www.tesco.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesco</a></span>: For taking the enlightened approach of making the process of requesting and receiving your data automatic. 
                    Without that I would not have bothered.</p>

                <p><span class="fw-bold">OpenAI - <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a></span>: I'm not a programmer, ChatGPT 
                    created most of this (even the logo), while also teaching me and assisting with my frustrations. The future is here and it is <em>wild</em>.</p>

                <p><span class="fw-bold">The makers</span>: The various indivduals and organisations that invest time and energy into creating frameworks that they then
                    allow anyone to use under very permissable licences. It is to stand on the shoulders of giants, namely

            <h3>Can I see the code? Can I contribute?</h3>

            <p>Nothing is minimised and as it is client-side you can see it all in your browser, I even left all the ChatGPT comments in.</p>
            <p>If my code makes your eyeballs bleed, and you want to help fix it, please go to <a href="https://github.com/trish1400/TrolleyTrends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>. Thanks!</p>
